<p> Hi, my name is Jennifer Edwards, and I'm a Web editor for a small, private college on Florida's East Coast. 
I've worked in content for a long, long time and am looking to aquire web skills. I'm also looking to grow as a person, 
because this class is a risk for me. I know nothing about code and I sweat when I don't get an 'A.' 
I'm hoping to learn Web skills, plus patience and grit. </p>
<p> 
<H1>My Top GoalsM/H1>
1. Learn the basics of web design, including basic coding
2. Flex and grow my reserves of patience, persistence, and humor
3. Work toward a certificate in web design
4. Graduate with my master's in mass communication from UF
5. Put everything I learn to good use for our team </p>
